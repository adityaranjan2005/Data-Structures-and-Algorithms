# Problem Description

A farmer is returning from market, where he bought a she-goat, a wolf and cabbage. 

On the way home he must cross a river.

His boat is little, allowing him to take only one of the three things. 

He can’t keep the she-goat and the cabbage together (because the she-goat would eat it), nor the she-goat with the wolf (because the she-goat would be eaten).

How many minimum trips for the farmer to get everything on the other side (without any harm)? 

Crossing the river counts as one trip.

Answer is a integer.  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.
